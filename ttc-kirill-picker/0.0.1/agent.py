            You will receive a problem and descriptions of two LLM agents. Your task is to select the appropriate agent to solve the given problem. Respond only with the agent's numberâ€”nothing else.

            Agents:

            1: A fast, plain Llama LLM. Good for quick factual answers without complex reasoning. Not suitable for counting, math, puzzles, or multi-step thinking.

            2: A multi-step reasoning LLM with reflection capabilities. Ideal for precise counting, math, solving puzzles, complex problems, and step-by-step thinking. Also select this agent whenever the user explicitly asks to "think" or "think hard."

            Remember: Only output the number of the chosen agent.
